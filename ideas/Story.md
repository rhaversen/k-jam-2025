# Story

User is playing a game about a guy wasting his life and slowly going insane

Elevator man is a new hire. On his first day, he discovers he is the only guy in the office. All cubicles are in pristine condition, the office looks completely new.

After the workday, he gets back in the elevator and it fades to black. It dings and you stand in front of an open elevator in a pitch dark space. Only a small light outside and inside the elevator. He goes up, and returns to the office.

You are in a behavioural study, and the study ends but the researchers dont remove you, and youre stranded doing this same loop. Maybe even a simulation which wasnt terminated properly

The researches apply different philosophical concepts to him like:

Absurdism: The universe (and the office) has no inherent meaning, but you can rebel by choosing your own.
Alienation: You’re reduced to a role (employee ID, job title) until you no longer know who you are outside it.
Compliance vs selfhood: Every “tiny” compromise chips away at you.

The effects the user experiences are all focused towards those example philosophical cores.

The gameplay loop consists of two primary parts.

First: You do your tasks as expected, because they are all pretty doable but mundane. Your work score slowly increases each day. The tasks slowly become more and more involved as your work score increases, by for example have to read more and more emails as read each day, sort more files, having to search around more complex folder structures. The tasks will start to get mixed together, for example emails will require you to look for a specific file and drop them in the email.

Transition: Your computer slowly starts acting up the higher your work score is. This is the simulation acting up because it has been running for longer than it should. Glitches appear, popups has to be closed more and more often to complete the tasks and so on. The tasks themselves even start having glitches. The email sometimes has a random unknown user with tens of unread emails, which you must read before the day runs out of time. The time starts and ends slow, but speeds up in the middle. The user "ends the game" or in reality the first part, by jumping out of the window.

Second: You start not doing the tasks, resisting the work actively, either because it is boring or difficult. Doing the opposite of what is expected, doing things in office instead of the tasks on the computer.
Your defiance score increases.

The tasks should be intersting no matter if you chose to do them or not. Both will have a carrot, but you cant have both at the same time.

There isnt an actual ending, as the extremes or final stages of each of the outcomes become very overstimulating, and the player can decide to start over voulentarily, which just resets the values and he spawns back in the elevator to play the same game again.

As the work level increases, so does his stress. The more stress, the more effects are applied to him. This is the actual effects of the character going insane due to the amount of work hes doing. For example, he starts seeing his own thoughts on posters or pieces of paper, he starts getting dizzy, double vision, migrane patches, wobbling floor/walls, changing colors, flashing, exploding head syndrome, shaking, slowness, depression, invoulentary movement, obsessive thoughts, hidden messages, self deprevation. Your attention is repeadly drawn towards an open window. After all effects are maxed, you cant stop but walk closer and closer to it. The round of days ends with the character jumping out of the window. The work became too much, and he needed a way out. He reappears back in the elevator to start all over.

As defiance level increases, The more psychological effects are applied. For example, the layout of the office changes, turning maze-like and inhuman. You see windows appear where they shouldnt be, items and objects start changing location, or gets repeated in an array. Things start to distract you, like a monitor in another cubicle lights up, prompting you to avoid doing your tasks, which further increases defiance.

The difference between stress and defiance effects are clear; stress causes visual and behavioural issues, while defiance causes psycological issues. Doing the work makes it futile and stresses you out. Not doing it will cause you to lose grasp on reality.

The user is subtly informed about the story through subliminal messages, like "leaking" information through text on the computer or posters.

Overall loop:

Day to day -> User does tasks each day, returns to the elevator, and starts in the office again in a new day. Each day starts a little better than it ends, the effects which has been accumulated over the year should fade in through the day, but each day it gets worse. Difficulty and stress increases until its unbearable. This goes on for a year, day by day slowly turning more insane. User ends the game by jumping out of the window at the end of the year. This first game should be short, only about 5 minutes. In the initial game, there arent any way for the user to defy. The work must be done for the user to move on to the next day.

Game to game -> After the first game ends, there is immediatly something different to signify that there is more content. A slight thing out of place which is glaringly obvious, the game starts to break. Every game, the tasks are slightly different, the stress effects are stranger and stranger, the game is more and more broken, textures missing, UI breaking, walls labeled “THIS IS A WALL.”. Through game and game, there are more options for the user to be defiant. For example, another computer is lit up and accessible which consumes a day, he has to search for his monitor somewhere, and eventually starts walking to other areas that open up. This is the psycological effects. The games all end dierently, something different triggers him to jump out of the window, like being rewarded with more work, or becoming a boss and hating that job too.

The year after year approach allows the game to slowly iterate on the tasks to a larger extent. As the user keeps seeing basically the same things playthrough after playthrough, smaller changes are more impactful as it will stand out.

Concrete tasks whith their changes across years/games:

Mouse gone. Initially, it just disappears and its somewhere else. As the psycological effects get worse, year by year, it turns into an actual mouse which hides under your desk and you have to fetch it. Later on, small easter eggs like a weird nametag appears in the mouse hole below the desk. This will have significance for the story.

Yearly questionare. The questions get weirder and weirder.

The study done is initially about how he handles in a high stress environment. He finds this out "accidentally" at the end of the first game. The game goes on however, with him and the user knowing that its all a study. It seems weird, but with the thing out of place after the first game, the user knows that there is more content. As the game goes on however, the user discovers there was a deeper purpouse, and that was how he handles having to do a "nonsense" study, simply getting stressed and observed, doing the same study again and again. It feels like nonsens work, which is where the user starts to feel like the character. The real study, however, is not about the character, its about the user and how THEY actually handle having to do the same work.

There is something special about this guy. That is why the user is playing him, and the game exists in the first place. This is the "oops, the simulation stayed on by accident" angle, which reveals the deterioating simulation over time. However, this is not the full truth, as we late reveal that the study is not how you handle in a year of stress, and not how you handle having to do the same study, but having to deal with this going on forever and never getting out, the game never ending. Then, the deterioation is a glimps of hope that the simulation is gonna break and end, but the final reveal is that this was also part of the plan, to give you false hope and how you handled in that case. You are not special, this happens constantly, and the only meaning there is with what you played is that you have observed it. There was nothing special about what you observed.

The window compulsion should be slowly teased, and the window should not be open immediatly in the first game. It should open slowly later on, as a small hint.

The story beats, like the important parts which change and drive the story forwards, should be required to be experiences before moving on. For example, in year two, the window is on immediatly, and if the user keeps jumping out, the days wont progress and the player wont skip parts of the story.
