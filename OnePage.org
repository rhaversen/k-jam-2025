- Sounds

*** Story

* Stress induced psychosis
** 1. Perceptual Distortions
- Hallucinations
- Auditory: Hearing voices (commenting, criticizing, or giving commands).
- Visual: Seeing shapes, shadows, or figures that aren’t there.
- Tactile / Sensory: Feeling touches, temperature changes, or movements that aren’t real.
- Altered senses
- Colors may seem more intense or muted.
- Sounds may be louder, distorted, or delayed.
- Objects may appear to “move” or change shape.

** 2. Thought and Cognitive Changes
- Delusions (false beliefs)
- Feeling watched, persecuted, or controlled.
- Believing personal experiences have unusual or symbolic meaning.
- Disorganized thinking
- Jumping from topic to topic.
- Difficulty concentrating or forming coherent sentences.
- Memory gaps
- Partial amnesia or “blackouts.”
- Confusing dreams with reality.

** 3. Emotional Changes
- Intense fear, paranoia, or anxiety.
- Rapid mood swings (from calm to terrified).
- Sense of unreality or detachment (derealization/depersonalization).

** 4. Behavioral Effects
- Confusion or disorientation in familiar surroundings.
- Impulsivity or unusual actions that don’t match the situation.
- Withdrawal from social interaction.
- Sometimes hyperactivity or agitation, sometimes lethargy.

** 5. Physiological Reactions
- Heart racing, sweating, hyperventilation due to anxiety.
- Sleep disruption, which worsens perception and stress.
- Sensory overload from bright lights, loud sounds, or crowded spaces.

** 6. Duration and Triggers
- Usually short-lived (hours to days) if the stressor is removed.
- Often triggered by extreme emotional trauma, sleep deprivation, or severe anxiety.
- May resolve naturally, but can recur if stress persists.
